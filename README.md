This project demonstrates how heatmaps can be used to visualize performance metrics such as TV show ratings. Each cell in the heatmap represents an episode's rating within a specific season. The unique aspect of this project is the use of custom shapes (rectangles or ellipses) for heatmap cells, improving the visual appeal.

Features
Custom Shapes: Choose between rectangles or ellipses to represent values.
Color Mapping: Configurable colormap options (default: Blues).
Annotations: Add rating values directly inside shapes.
Axis Customization: Modify fonts, colors, and sizes of axis labels.
Background and Text Colors: Control the theme with customizable background and text colors.
